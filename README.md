Fully responsive, the website adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, providing an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile devices. The design focuses on usability and a modern aesthetic, enhancing engagement through intuitive navigation and clean, accessible content.

## My process

I initially developed the website entirely for the desktop version. Once all elements were in place and aligned with the design requirements, I adapted it for mobile by implementing responsive styling with a single CSS media query.
